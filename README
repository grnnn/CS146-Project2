Engine files are included in the engine directory.
When altering the engine remember:
-class files (*.cpp) are members of the engine directory
-Header files (*.hpp) are members of the engine\headers directory
-resource files (*.inl) are members of the engine\headers\resources directory

Source files appropriately while coding.
